## About
Cordium.js is a library written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that aims to assist in the development of bots for Discord, the library has several classes, managers and interfaces to facilitate the interaction with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), in addition to being fully customizable, cordium.js is still in the alpha phase of development and is not ready to be used in production.

**You can check the full documentation [here](https://cordiumjs.vercel.app/)**

## Installation
```sh
npm install cordium.js
```

## Features
- Shard support
- Fully customizable
- Single dependency
- Vertically scalable
- Multi-core support

## Examples
If you are going to copy these examples, remember to change the Discord authentication token, you can create a Bot and get its token here: [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

#### Simple command
```ts copy showLineNumbers
import { Client, Intents } from 'cordium.js';

(async () => {
  const client = new Client('MTE1NzcyMDExNDMwMTUxNzkyNA.GyqSdV.H5bxTCTKBG6kJP-B0HUaSTVIVE7FhJsk-MR8VM', {
    // Set the required intents to receive message & guild related events.
    intents: [ Intents.GUILD, Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.GUILD_MEMBERS, Intents.MESSAGE_CONTENT ]
  });
  await client.init();

  // Subscribe to the "ready" event.
  client.events.ready.subscribe(() => {
    console.log(`I logged in as (${client.user?.username})`);
  });

  // Subscribe to the "messageCreate" event.
  client.events.messageCreate.subscribe(async (message) => {
    // Ignore the command if is exectued by a Bot.
    if(message.author.bot) return;

    if(message.content == '!ping') {
      // Send a message referencied by the author message.
      // client.shards.ping is an average of the ping of all connected shards, in this case a single shard.
      return await message.sendReference(`My ping is: \`${client.shards.ping}\`ms`);
    }
  });
```

#### Sharding
```ts copy showLineNumbers
import { Client, Intents } from 'cordium.js';

(async () => {
  const client = new Client('MTE1NzcyMDExNDMwMTUxNzkyNA.GyqSdV.H5bxTCTKBG6kJP-B0HUaSTVIVE7FhJsk-MR8VM', {
    // Set the required intents to receive message & guild related events.
    intents: [ Intents.GUILD, Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.GUILD_MEMBERS, Intents.MESSAGE_CONTENT ],
    sharding: {
      // The total number of shards that will be initialized.
      totalShards: 4
    }
  });
  await client.init();

  // Subscribe to the "ready" event.
  // ready event will be fired when all shards are connected.
  client.events.ready.subscribe(() => {
    console.log(`I logged in as (${client.user?.username})`);
  });

  // Subscribe to the "shardReady" event.
  client.events.shardReady.subscribe((shard) => {
    console.log(`Shard connected: ${shard.id}`);
  });

  // Subscribe to the "messageCreate" event.
  client.events.messageCreate.subscribe(async (message) => {
    // Ignore the command if is exectued by a Bot.
    if(message.author.bot) return;

    if(message.content == '!ping') {
      // Send a message referencied by the author message.
      // client.shards.ping is an average of the ping of all connected shards, in this case a single shard.
      return await message.sendReference(`My ping is: \`${client.shards.ping}\`ms`);
    }
  });
})();
```

### Clusterized sharding
```ts copy showLineNumbers
import { ClusterManager, Intents } from 'cordium.js';

(async () => {
  // Instead of instantiating a normal Client, we will instantiate the ClusterManager
  const manager = new ClusterManager('MTE1NzcyMDExNDMwMTUxNzkyNA.GyqSdV.H5bxTCTKBG6kJP-B0HUaSTVIVE7FhJsk-MR8VM', {
    // Set the required intents to receive message & guild related events.
    intents: [ Intents.GUILD, Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.GUILD_MEMBERS, Intents.MESSAGE_CONTENT ],
    sharding: {
      // The total number of shards that will be initialized.
      // Must be greater than the number of workers
      totalShards: 4
    },
    clustering: {
      // The total number of workers that will be spawned.
      // Keep in mind that each worker (cluster) will have a specific number of shards and this number is measured as follows
      // (totalShards / totalWorkers) This means that the number of shards will be divided among all workers, therefore, there cannot be more workers than shards
      totalWorkers: 2
    }
  });
  await manager.init();

  // This event will be fired whenever a worker is spawned and will return an instance of ClusterClient
  // a ClusterClient is just an extended Client class that contains some new properties
  manager.events.workerSpawned.subscribe(async (client) => {
    // Subscribe to the "ready" event.
    // ready event will be fired when all shards are connected.
    client.events.ready.subscribe(() => {
      console.log(`I logged in as (${client.user?.username}) (PID=${process.pid})`);
    });

    // Subscribe to the "shardReady" event.
    client.events.shardReady.subscribe((shard) => {
      console.log(`Shard connected: ${shard.id}/PID = ${process.pid}`);
    });

    // Subscribe to the "messageCreate" event.
    client.events.messageCreate.subscribe(async (message) => {
      // Ignore the command if is exectued by a Bot.
      if(message.author.bot) return;

      if(message.content == '!ping') {
        // Send a message referencied by the author message.
        // client.shards.ping is an average of the ping of all connected shards, in this case a single shard.
        return await message.sendReference(`My ping is: \`${client.shards.ping}\`ms \nMy PID: \`${process.pid}\``);
      }
    });

    // You need to initialize the client
    await client.init();
  });
})();
```
